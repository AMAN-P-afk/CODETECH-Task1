Project Overview: Temperature Conversion Program
1.** Objective**
Utility: To create a simple program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
User Convenience: To provide an easy-to-use interface for users to perform temperature conversions quickly and accurately.
Educational Tool: To serve as a learning resource for understanding temperature scales and their relationships.

2. Key Activities
Function Development: Creating dedicated functions for each type of temperature conversion (Celsius to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Celsius, etc.).
User Interaction: Designing a user interface that prompts users to select their desired conversion type and input the temperature value.
Input Validation: Implementing a switch-case statement to handle user input and ensure the selected conversion is valid.
Output Formatting: Ensuring the output is displayed with two decimal places for improved readability and precision.

4. Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++ was chosen for its efficiency and straightforward syntax for mathematical operations.
Standard Libraries: Utilized <iostream> for input/output operations and <iomanip> for controlling the formatting of output (setting precision).
Control Structures: Employed functions for modularity and readability, and used switch-case statements for clear decision-making based on user input.

6. Key Insights
Modularity: The use of separate functions for each conversion enhances code readability and maintainability, allowing easy updates or additions in the future.
User Experience: A clear and straightforward user interface improves usability, encouraging users to engage with the program.
Error Handling: Implementing basic input validation, like checking for valid conversion choices, is essential for a robust application, preventing crashes from invalid input.
Practical Application: Such utility programs are widely used in various fields, including science and engineering, demonstrating the importance of basic conversion tools in everyday applications.
